# 查询语句

### 创建表

``` sql
create table students (
	id int,
	student_name varchar(20),
	sex char(1),
	age int,
	achievement double(5,2),
	team_id int,
	graduation_date date
);

```

### 添加数据

``` sql
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1,'XiaoMing',0,7,100,1,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (2,'XiaoHong',1,8,199,1,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (3,'XiaoLiang',0,15,60,2,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (4,'XiaoMing',0,18,88,2,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (5,'XiaoZhang',1,2,110.5,3,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (6,'XiaoLi',0,6,30,3,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (7,'XiaoLiu',0,3,null,4,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (8,'ZhangSan',0,6,50,4,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (9,'WangWu',0,6,40,4,'2020-7-1');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (10,'XiaoEr',0,6,40,null,'2020-7-1');
```

### 简单的查询

``` sql
SELECT * FROM students;  
SELECT student,achievement FROM students;
SELECT student_name,achievement,age+18 FROM students;  --不影响数据
SELECT student_name,achievement,age+18 AS 18_years_later FROM students;  --as 设置别名
SELECT student_name,achievement,age,age+18 AS '18年以后' FROM students;
```

### 按条件查询

``` sql
SELECT* FROM students WHERE id = 1;  --where 设置条件
SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_name = 'xiaoming' AND age = 18;
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 10 -- <>不等于,>大于，<小于
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >=3 AND age <= 15;
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age BETWEEN 3 AND 15;
SELECT * FROM students WHERE achievement IS NULL; 
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 3 OR age = 18;;
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age IN (3,18,15);
select * from tbname where name like '%x%'; -- 字段包含x的内容。
```

### 排序

``` sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age;  -- 升序
SELECT * FROM students WHERE achievement >= 60  ORDER BY age; -- 先写条件，在写排序
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age ASC; --升序
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC; --降序
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age, achievement; --按年龄和成绩排序
```
